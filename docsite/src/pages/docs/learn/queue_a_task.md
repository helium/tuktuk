## Queue a task

You can queue a task by using the `QueueTaskV0` instruction. There are many ways to call this function. You can do this via CPI in your smart contract, or you can use typescript. For examples of doing this in typescript, see the [typescript-examples](https://github.com/helium/tuktuk/tree/main/typescript-examples) folder.

Similar functions are available in the tuktuk-sdk rust library. For an example of how to use this in a solana program, see the [cpi-example](https://github.com/helium/tuktuk/tree/main/solana-programs/programs/cpi-example) and the corresponding [tests](https://github.com/helium/tuktuk/tree/main/solana-programs/tests/tuktuk.ts).
